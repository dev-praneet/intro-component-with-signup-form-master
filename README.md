## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### What I learned



### To Know Further

- When I was using a pseudo after element with absolute positioning to display the error messages, it was being displayed only for the last box and not for the other boxes but it was working fine with static positioning. I don't understand why this happens? Got it. It was happening because the messages were being hidden inside the next input box.
